When you turn 18, you buy a new game console and you get logged into a game where if you die in the game you die in real life.

It was a dark and stormy night in the game console.  I'm writing this as Cam McGown, renowned author of old, overdone writing prompts, but I am trapped inside a video game where Quoncy Tonnis is coming for me.  He is 7 feet tall, and is wearing a Trex costume.
